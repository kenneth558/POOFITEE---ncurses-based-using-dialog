# POOFITEE---uses dialog (nice looking pseudo gui) if available 
-- At first blush, we thought POOFITEE was operational 2016-09-16, but a few bugs remain

On Sep 18, 2020 I made an honest effort to synchronize both versions of this script with improvements that had been made to one and not brought into the other due to probable interruptions.

NOTE:  THIS SCRIPT WAS MADE TO OPERATE UNDER SysVInit rather than systemd!  Truth be told, I abandoned working on this for so long due to my discovery that Ubuntu was headed to systemd several years ago.  The reason I came back to work on this is because I now needed it for another building.  Still no systemd, though.
